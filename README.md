# m10c-content-elements

Shared CMS content elements for m10c projects. It powers a block-based page
editor in the **admin** app and renders that content (with live preview) in the
**web** app. It pairs with `m10c-mui-kit` for the underlying form/theme
primitives.

A page is a list of typed **blocks** — e.g. a hero, an info section, feature
cards. Each block has a `type` and a `data` object. The admin app edits this
list of blocks; the web app reads it and renders each block. The shared `Block`
types keep both sides in agreement on the shape of that data.

## Admin app — editing

The editor is two components:

- **`PageEditor`** — edits the page's blocks. It renders a form for the block
  list on one side and a live preview iframe (pointed at the web app) on the
  other. `field` is a [`react-typed-form`](../react-typed-form) field holding the
  `Block[]`; `previewUrl` is the deployed web app's origin; `pagePath` is the
  page being edited (`'home'` maps to the site root). `previewContent` is the
  current form state, which is what gets streamed to the preview.
- **`SeoEditor`** — edits a page's SEO title, description, and share image.

```typescript
import { PageEditor } from 'm10c-content-elements/website-pages/components';

<PageEditor
  blockTypes={blockTypes}
  field={form.getField('blocks')}
  previewUrl={websitePreviewUrl}
  pagePath={page.path}
  previewContent={form.values}
  onPublish={() => form.handleSubmit()}
/>
```

Each block field can be rendered with a custom input by passing `renderers`
(e.g. a rich-text or image-upload field for certain field kinds); otherwise a
default input is used.

## Web app — rendering

Fetch the page on the server, pass it to `useWebsiteData` as `initialData`, and
render the blocks it returns:

```typescript
import { useWebsiteData } from 'm10c-content-elements/website-pages/hooks';
import type { Block } from 'm10c-content-elements/website-pages/types';

const { data } = useWebsiteData({ path: 'about', initialData });
const blocks = data.blocks as Block[];
// render each block by its type…
```

`useWebsiteData` returns the server-fetched content for the live page, and
transparently swaps in preview content when the page is open inside the editor
(see below). The web app doesn't fetch again on the client — the server data is
the source of truth for the published page.

## Live preview

While editing, the admin shows the web app in an iframe and streams the
in-progress edits into it, so the page updates instantly without saving. The
admin side is handled by `PageEditor`; the web side by `useWebsiteData` — neither
app needs extra setup.

The only requirement is that the admin's `previewUrl` is set to the web app's
exact origin (matching scheme, host, and port), since that's the page the editor
loads and sends edits to.
